A simple utility to bulk rename files, build to run in atom-shell.

Version
-------

Currently heavily under development and in early alpha.

How to Run
-------

To Run, drag the app folder onto Atom Shell. Alternately (Mac), go to the root directory and run: 

/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/MacOS/Atom . debug=5858

You'll need to run `npm install` in the root directory first, to install all the node dependencies
